# Aviom Search

Project # 2

During my 2nd week on the bootcamp, we were asked to make a website containing different kinds of inputs. The objective was to apply at least 10 HTML input types. This website was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. My attempt to replicate the Google Search theme was also added to the form action parameter.
